****************************************** Create Branch & Push Branch to Repository ************************************

1)   Create Branch on local = git branch branch_name
2)   Create Branch on account = git checkout -b shivapoudyal2
3)   Rename the current branch = git branch -m new_branch
4)   Please Tell Me Who Are You = 
        git config user.name account_name
        git config user.email "someone@someplace.com"


5)   GIT Remote Add (without cloning)

    a) git init
    b) git remote add origin https://github.com/shivapoudyal/repo_name.git

Note: Very first take a clone of a repository and create a branch under that repository folder and push the branch into that repository.


6)   fatal: remote origin already exists.

        git remote set-url origin https://github.com/shivapoudyal/java-project.git

    (Note:- this error occurs when you clone from other account and want to push another account)

7)   Set git credential (so that we no need to put again and again)
        git config --global credential.helper cache  (enter credential for last time and it will not ask again) 
        
8)   Undo git credentials which set on cache
        git config --global --unset credential.helper
