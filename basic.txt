GIT Remote Add (without cloning)

        a) git init
    b) git remote add origin https://github.com/shivapoudyal/repo_name.git

Note: Very first take a clone of a repository and create a branch under that repository folder and push the branch into that repository.


fatal: remote origin already exists.

    git remote set-url origin https://github.com/shivapoudyal/java-project.git

    (Note:- this error occurs when you clone from other account and want to push another account)
